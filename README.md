# Advent of Code 2022
This is a repository of my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](adventofcode.com). This is the second year that I have participated, and the first time I'm participating from Day 1. My goal for this year is to eventually finish, something I struggled with last year due to the typical end-of-semester chaos that comes this time of year when you're a college student.

This year I've decided to write my solutions in C#. I'm actually fairly inexperienced with this language, which is why I'm hoping that these puzzles will give me an opportunity to get a solid foundation in it. Java is my current preferred language, but from the work I've already done with C# I have a suspicion it will overtake it soon.

I'll probably come back and upate this README as the month goes on, making notes about things that I learned or had to do to get through the challenges. I'll try and eventually write a wrap-up blog post of some sort, and if I'll post it on [natewebber.dev]() and link it here.
